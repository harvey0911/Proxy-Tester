# Proxy-Tester

 While exploring tools like Nmap, I realized the  disclosure of my IP address during scans. Seeking an alternative, I tried proxy chaining .I was in the need of several  functional proxies. This led to the creation of a Python script that automates the testing of proxy servers obtained from online lists. 
# Dependencies
